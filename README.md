# OOP Simple Quiz Game in C++
Implementing a basic Quiz Game on the topic of Object Oriented Programming in C++ that uses concepts of switch case and if-else statements (meant specifically for school students as an implementation based learning experience)
## Brief Overview:
* This simple project contains a series of questions on the topic of OOP presented in the form of a multiple-choice based quiz game.
* Points are alloted for each correct answer and wrong answers are notified to the player.
* Players can see their total score at the end of the quiz.
## How to expand the game further:
* Number of questions can be increased by adding the if-else statements and switch-cases in the main code as per wish 
* Stars/comments can be alloted to the players based on their performance (in the range of their achieved score)
* Leaderboard of the quiz can also be implemented by designing a class and a file stream to record the names and scores of all players
